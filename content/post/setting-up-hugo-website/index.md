### Intro

First steps into getting a static website running. Probably this is the place where I can put learned lessons for myself as I always feel the need after burrowing through several interesting instructions, only to realise after a lot of time that one variable changed over time that makes the instructions obsolete.

For getting a website with Hugo up and running, the most simple instructions I found were also the official ones: https://docs.hugoblox.com/tutorial/blog/.
