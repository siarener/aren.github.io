# [Aren's blog with help of Hugo and GitHub pages](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-blog)

For this website, I used Hugo Blox, "an all-in-one web framework for easily building any kind of website with blocks (no-code)" (https://docs.hugoblox.com/). My goal is to create a simple website where I can store knowledge, and lessons-learned without having to spend too much time on web programming.
